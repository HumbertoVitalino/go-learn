# go-learn

Welcome to **go-learn** — a personal project where I explore and practice the **Go programming language** (also known as Golang).

## 📚 Purpose

This repository is part of my learning journey. I'm using it to:

- Practice writing Go code 🧑‍💻  
- Learn Go fundamentals and standard libraries  
- Build small projects, tools, and experiments  
- Improve my coding style and problem-solving skills  
- Practice writing and communicating in English 🇬🇧

## 📁 What's Inside

You'll find:

- Basic Go exercises and examples  
- Notes or explanations (in English)  
- Mini-projects or CLI tools  
- Experiments with Go packages and features  

Everything is organized to reflect what I'm currently learning.

## 🚀 Goals

- Get comfortable with Go syntax and best practices  
- Build useful or fun tools using Go  
- Grow my English writing and communication skills  
- Document what I learn so I can come back to it later  

## ✅ Status

🟢 *Work in progress* — I’m actively adding new content as I learn.

## 💬 Feedback

Feel free to open an issue or leave a comment if you have suggestions or tips — especially if you notice any mistakes in my English or code! I'm always happy to learn.
